# PBS_threejs

This repo contains a bunch of code I've used during the thesis for my graduation in *Virtual Reality Programming and 3D Graphics*. Here is a video showing the application running on Chrome: [Physically Based Shading in Three.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIMQb5TRfQg).

The main code consists in a **GLSL-ES** program used in a [three.js](https://threejs.org/) scene (revision 67, since this code was developed in late 2014) for web representation of a physically based shading model.

The code is not even close to be used in production: the goal of this was to study shading models from SIGGRAPH notes (most of them [here](https://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2013-shading-course/)) and to approach shaders development in order to implement the theory.
